# cypher
This is an old project, but I like the function. I am currently working on refactoring the code, and redesigning it so I do not have to use global variables. 
It is also very likely that I will switch the code to TypeScript. 

I have an RSA option in the works, and am just working on optimizations for encryption speed, but soon enough will add it as an option.
